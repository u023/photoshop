/* This text is announced using VoiceOver when a new message is recieved (in the foreground) in chat that is currently not on screen, where the chat that the message originated from is a group chat.
 The announcement has three parameters: "Author name", "Message text", "Conversation name".
 
 ---
 
 Since the message could potentially be announced frequently and distrupt the user, please make the string as concise as possible.
 
 For example:
 "David Rönnqvist: 'What will the weather be like?'. In 'Vacation Plans'"
 is more concise than
 "David Rönnqvist said 'What will the weather be like?' in the chat 'Vacation Plans'"
 and is probably clear enough for the user to understand where the message came from.
 
 ---
 
 Since the different parameters have different length and different importance AND since the message could be interupted (either by another message or by a user action) at any time, consider the order of the parameters (where the language permits doing so):
 
 - "Author name" is often fairly short and resonably important
 - "Message text" is the actual content (which makes it the most important part of information) but it could be a full paragraph of text.
 - "Conversation name" is often fairly short but is only relevant if the author is in multiple group chats with the user.
 
 For example, in the messages below the user can resonably figure out by the message what chat it belongs to and can then confirm their assumption after the full message has been read. Note that this difference is most notable when there are multiple messages recieved in the same chat.
 
 Compare these two variations (same messages):
 
 "David Rönnqvist: 'What will the weather be like?'. In 'Vacation Plans'"
 "David Rönnqvist: 'I don't what clothes I should bring'. In 'Vacation Plans'"
 "David Rönnqvist: 'Do you think that I need to bring a sweater if we leave the first week of August or will it still be warm enough?'. In 'Vacation Plans'"
 
 "David Rönnqvist in 'Vacation Plans': 'What will the weather be like?'"
 "David Rönnqvist in 'Vacation Plans': 'I don't what clothes I should bring'"
 "David Rönnqvist in 'Vacation Plans': 'Do you think that I need to bring a sweater if we leave the first week of August or will it still be warm enough?'"
 
 In the second example, reading the conversation name before the message could end up being an annoyance, delaying the user from getting to the new message.
